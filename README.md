# Have Songs Gotten More Upbeat Over the Last Decade? 

This is my final dashboard for MA705, where I use many of the skills and tools I learned over the semester to create something that is useful, and that I am proud of. 

## Purpose of Dashboard 

Being an avid music fan myself, I was curious to see how trends in music have changed over the last decade. With apps like Instagram and TikTok becoming more popular, my driving question was whether songs have gotten more upbeat over the last decade. 

Using a publicly available dataset, I performed some minor cleaning and data munging using pandas and numpy tools to make the data easier to work with. Then, using Dash and Plotly I built a graph and table that updates itself based on user inputs. 

For example, if you're curious to see solo artists that make high tempo, upbeat songs & their relative BPM, you can filter for that and see how it has changed (or not changed!) over time. 

### Data Description 

A link to the data is available on the upper left hand corner of the Dashboard and here:

I used no other sources to build this dashboard. 

### Further Comments 

Thanks a ton for everything you taught us this semester. Looking back at when I was struggling to write a for loop in January, it's cool to see what I was able to build by just putting in the hours and practicing, doing the problem sets, and visiting office hours. See you in Time Series, and go Celtics!
